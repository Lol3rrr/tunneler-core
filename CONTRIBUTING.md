# CONTRIBUTING

## Releasing a new Version
All Releases are made on the master-branch. To create a new Release:
* Make sure the `cargo.toml` is updated with the newest version set
* Create a new Tag with the Version in the format `v[Major].[Minor].[Path]` and push it
* The created Release should then be Reviewed once more to make sure it all went according to plan
* Approve the Release if everything is good
